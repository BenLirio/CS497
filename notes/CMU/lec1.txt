Intersection of
 - Physics
 - Math
 - C.S.

Computational Complexity/Efficiency
 - Are they more powerful?
 - When are they more powerful?

Physical vs Unphysical Numbers
 - Physical: Easy to imagine
 - Unphysical: Used in theory

Multiplication is n^2 in the number of bits
Or n log(n) steps using Schonhage-Strassen
Using FFT

FFT is at the heart of QuantumComputation
